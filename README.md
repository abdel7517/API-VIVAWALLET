# API-VIVAWALLET
It's a API for get the status of a paiment with vivawallet and send automaticly a mail if in succes case.
I make it for neededs of a project of a app because i do redirected the user on the paiment's plateform and i don't have a callback of the plateforme.
So this API will check if the client have payed and send a mail if it's the case
